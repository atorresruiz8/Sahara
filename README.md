# Sahara

## Project Description
Sahara is a web shop app created by Antonio Torres-Ruiz, Peter Gray and Justin Horner that allows users to browse a catalog and purchase products of their interests; this application also stores said items in a shopping cart, or a wishlist as the user sees fit. It also allows guests without an account to login as a temporary user with limited functionality.

## Features
* Create an Account with a user's name, phone number, email and password. Stored onto the phone in CoreData.
* Allows the user to choose whether they want to sign in via email or phone number.
* Displays messages that list the current user's information as input.
* Allows the user to search through the store via tags or direct string input, displaying them results should anything in the store match the user's search.
* A store featuring 30 dynamically programmed products within 5 departments for the user to choose from.
* Stores user's selected products in a cart or wishlist that the user has regular access to.
* Displays the user's latest 5 searches and can clear their entire search history.
* The user can ask for refunds from their purchased products to receive money in their Sahara online wallet.
* Sahara "Silk Road," a subscription feature for expediated shipping of products.
* User can pay for their product with either cash on delivery, net banking, or credit/debit card.
* User can edit their shipping address, account information, or payment information at any time and have it instantly updated.
* Users can create temporary user accounts to browse the store and make a wishlist.
* Though temporary users cannot buy products, they can choose to upgrade and finish account creation to become a full fledged user and purchase goods from the store.

## TODO
* Implement a manner to let user choose their own profile picture, cancel orders, list retail vs sales prices for each product.
