# Sahara

## Project Description
Sahara is a web shop app created by Antonio Torres-Ruiz, Peter Gray and Justin Horner that allows users to browse a catalog and purchase products of their interests; this application also stores said items in a shopping cart, or a wishlist as the user sees fit. It also allows guests without an account to login as a temporary user with limited functionality.

## Features
* Create an Account with a user's name, phone number, email and password. Stored onto the phone in CoreData.
* Allows the user to choose whether they want to sign in via email or phone number.
* Displays messages that list the current user's information as input.
* 

## TODO
* Implement a manner to let user choose their own profile picture, cancel orders, list retail vs sales prices for each product.

## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/atorresruiz8/Sahara
* Must be on MacOS and have Xcode installed.
* In Sahara folder, open the Sahara.xcodeproj project file.
* This app is primarily designed with the iPhone 11 in mind, so run the simulator using an iPhone 11 for the proper viewing experience.
* Build the project and run the app on a simulator, or iPhone.
